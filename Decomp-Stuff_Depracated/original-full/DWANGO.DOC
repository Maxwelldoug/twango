		  DWANGO is COMPETITION ON DEMAND !


DWANGO, short for "Dial-Up Wide Area Network Gaming Organization", is a
revolutionary way to play real time on-line "twitch" games like Doom against 
others players from the convenience of your own home or office.  You can dial
in to chat and play with or against other gamers from all around the world.

In the past, finding a new player to play was a difficult task.  With DWANGO,
no matter the time, you can always find someone different to play against.
Try your skills against others, even the people who made the games you are
playing!

NOTE:  DWANGO is not available in every city, so you may need to dial
long-distance to access the service.  If you can not afford the charges,
please don't run DWANGO.  If you're under 18 please get permission before
dialing long-distance.

First-time callers get a half-hour of FREE time to try out DWANGO.  During
this time you have full access to all the features of DWANGO.  To continue
using DWANGO after your free half-hour is up, you will need to purchase
credits on-line via your credit card or send a check or money order to:

			IVS Corporation
		     9337-B Katy Freeway #325
		      Houston, Texas 77024

Please be sure to include your handle and the DWANGO server in which you
are on.

		     ³   Getting Started   ³
		     ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

DWANGO needs to be run from a \DWANGO directory.  From there, just type 
DWANGO and you are ready to go.

First off, DWANGO needs to know your configuration, so when you first run
DWANGO, the "Create Configuration" panel will come up.  You need to enter
your BAUD RATE, COM PORT, and your MODEM TYPE.

For baud rate, start off with the fastest baud possible first, 38400.  
Next select the COM port to which your modem is connected.  You then need
to choose the type of modem you are using.  Press F1 to choose your modem 
from a list of popular modems.  Press the F10 key to tell DWANGO that you're
finished configuring.

You will next be asked to pick a server.  Choose the DWANGO server that you
wish to connect to.  Should you later wish to try an additional DWANGO server,
you can type "DWANGO -SERVER" from the DOS prompt to selection a different
location to call.

You next will be able to set your dialing options.  You first need to select
if the server you are calling is a LOCAL or LONG-DISTANCE call.  If your phone
line has call-waiting, you can disable it by selecting the "Disable Call
Waiting" option.  Press the F10 key to tell DWANGO that you're finished
configuring.

Note:  If your disable code is not the default "*70", you can modify it by
       editing your DWANGO.CFG.

Here is an example DWANGO.CFG:
  
DWANGO Config Version 2.02
initstring: AT M1 &A0&M0&H0&K0&N8
server#: 1-214-686-8783
servername: Dallas
comport: com2
baud: 38400
mute: 1
videomode: 1
modem: US Robotics Sportster



Line Two, initstring is where you configure your modem for use on DWANGO.
Line Three, server#, is the number that will be dialed to access DWANGO.
 It may be necessary to change this if you first must dial 9 for an outside
 line, which would look like this:

server#: 9,1-214-686-8783

Line Five, comport, needs to be the port in which your modem is connected to.
Line Six, baud, is commonly set to either 19200 or 38400, it is suggested
 to use 38400 first.




The program will then initialize your modem and dial DWANGO.  When the DWANGO
Server answers, DWANGO will attempt to connect to the server.  If connection
does not happen within 20 seconds, something is wrong with either your
BAUD RATE or your MODEM INIT STRING.  First, try to change your BAUD RATE
by typing "DWANGO -CONFIG" from the dos prompt.  This will allow you to
re-configure your system for DWANGO.  Your configuration is stored in
a file called DWANGO.CFG.

Next, DWANGO is ready for you to log in.  Upon connection, DWANGO will tell
you that it does not recognize you and allow you to sign up.  You will answer
a few basic questions about yourself.  The username is your "handle" online;
it doesn't need to be your real name.  Press <ENTER> after editing an item and
you will be moved to the next item.  If you need to go back and edit your
information, just use the arrow keys to move back to the item.  The password
field will be your permanent password, so choose something you'll remember
easily.  Every time you log in to DWANGO after this time, you'll need to
enter both your USERNAME and PASSWORD to get into the system.  Press F10
when you've filled in all fields to enter DWANGO!

		 ³ DWANGO - The On-Line Experience ³
		 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

When you enter DWANGO, your screen will come up with a list of all users
online at the top.  This area of the screen lists information such as their
"handle", their computer speed, the team they belong to, the game they
are wanting to play, and which version of the game they are using (you must
have matching versions to play on the same team).  You will see your name
on the list but no game beside it, you first must choose which game you
want to play.  Hit F6 to select your game.  (See "CONFIGURING GAMES" for
game setup instructions)

You will begin to see text start scrolling up the screen from the other users
online.  They are talking to each other -- feel free to join in.  Go ahead
and type, "I'm new here!" and press the ENTER key.  Someone will strike up
a conversation with you and ask you to play.  Everything you type on the
message line will be sent to the server when you press ENTER.  This area
where everyone chats is called "The Lobby".

If, for any reason, some information in the userlist becomes garbled, you
can press the F8 key to redisplay the userlist.  And if 25-lines vertically
isn't enough for you, press the F9 key to toggle between 25 and 50-line video
modes.  The ESC key will allow you to exit back to DOS.

If you want to type a private message to just one person, type that person's 
name, a space, then the message.  For example, if you wanted to tell "shadow" 
that you wanted to play him, you would type:

shadow I would like to play you.

What shadow would see is:

<your name> TELLs you: I would like to play you.

If you log onto the server and you're the only one there that is not playing,
but there are teams already playing and you want to join in, you can send a
message to a person on the team, or to all the people on the team.  Just type
the name of a person on the team, or the team name, a space, then your message.

An example would be:

level7 i want to join in!

If the team name is "level7", everyone on the team would get that message.
If they decide to let you in, then you would see them stop playing their
game and start talking to you in the Lobby.

If someone creates a team, you will see a message stating that someone
has created a team.  If you want to play on that team, press F3 to join.
This will bring up a Join Team panel -- use the arrow keys to choose the
team you want to join.


Here is an example of how you can "customize" your team when creating teams
for DOOM:

If you want to create a team, press F2 and the Create Team panel will come
up.  The most common default options are listed.  You can choose whether
this will be a Deathmatch or Cooperative game, which skill level to use,
if you want monsters on the level (no monsters is the default), which
map/level and episode you want to play, and the team name.  You can
edit any of these options by using the cursor keys to navigate the panel
and press ENTER to change a field.  If you want to play a PWAD file, press
the F1 key and choose which PWAD from the list of PWADs that you have.  You
must have a WADS subdirectory off the current directory you're in to choose
PWADs.  For example, if your game was DOOM 2 and in a directory called
C:\DOOM2, then the directory for PWADs would be C:\DOOM2\WADS.

To create the team, press the F10 key.  Soon you will see people joining the
team you created!  When you have enough people on your team, press the F10
key to leave the Lobby and launch into your game.

When you come back from your game, DWANGO will reload the userlist for you,
since some people may have left or joined the server while you were playing.

To set-up your games to play on DWANGO, you first have to tell the DWANGO
software where they are located.  Go to the OPTIONS (F7) screen and choose
SETUP GAME.  Here you will then enter the drive letter and the directory 
where your games are located.

		 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

If you wish to purchase credits, you need to enter Billing (F5).  To 
purchase time on DWANGO, you first must be a subscriber.  Select "Subscribe 
to DWANGO" from the menu.  This is where you enter your VISA or Mastercard 
credit card number and expiration date.  You need to fill in the rest of 
the information on this screen for verification purposes.  Press the F10 
key to process your credit card information.

Now, you need to buy time so you can play.  From the billing menu,
choose "Acquire More Time".  Choose the pricing plan you desire and hit 
enter.  Press the ESC key if you're just browsing.

When you choose the amount of time, your credit card is used for the 
transaction (assuming you've already entered your credit card number).
No hassles!  Unless, of course, the server comes back and tells you that
your credit was rejected.  As always, call us at 713-467-0405 to find out
the solution to your problems.

IMPORTANT: Your time is used up ONLY WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME.  Just
sitting in the lobby chatting with others doesn't take away from your credits.
       
If you don't have a credit card to buy time, you need to call 713-467-0405
to have payment worked out with you.

At any time, you can check your remaining online time credits by choosing
the function from the Billing menu.  This will display your remaining time
you have for play.

As a subscriber, you will be billed $7.95 a month and will be given five
additional hours of credit.  You may cancel your membership at any time 
to avoid future monthly membership charges.  To do this, select the
"Cancel DWANGO Subscription" from the billing menu. When you unsubscribe
your user account is removed from that DWANGO server.

To run DWANGO, you must be sure that no memory managers are loaded.  You
can also not run DWANGO under any multitasking environments such as Windows,
Windows 95 or Desqview.  You can solve this problem by doing one of the
following:

	  - Create a boot disk that loads only the important files
	    necessary for use on DWANGO (i.e. sound card drivers, mouse
	    drives, etc).

	  - Step through your autoexec.bat and config.sys line-by-line 
	    by hitting F8 whenever your system first starts up.

	  - Completely bypass your autoexec.bat and config.sys files
	    by hitting F5 whenever your system first starts up.

"Why am I not connecting at 14400?"

This problem is common when you use the standard init string.  Edit
the DWANGO.CFG file and check the BAUD.  If that line is set at 9600 
then you should adjust it to a higher rate(19200 and 38400 are commonly 
used).  Also, if you have a "S37=9" in the init string, that will most 
likely be causing the modem to connect at 9600 baud.  Remove if its there.  
Another common way to force the modem to 9600 is to have "&N6" in the init 
string.  Remember, these will vary from modem to modem, so you may have to 
have to get the manual and go over each command one-by-one.

Here are some init strings for a few modems that are found to work:

 GVC                 : AT &F \Q0 
 INTEL 144/144e      : AT \N0 \Q0 \J1 \V
 PPI 14400           : AT &F &C1 &K0 &Q5 S46=0
 PPI Pro             : AT &C2 &D2 &K0 &Q5 s46=0 s11=55
 USR Sportster 14.4  : AT &A0&M0&K0&H0&N8
 VIVA 14.4           : AT &F&C1&D2S11=50W1s95=3
 ZOOM Fax 14.4       : AT &F C1 &D2S46=0 N0 &KO


"Why does it keep locking up?"

Sometimes when launching into a game, one of the players may not make
it or may hang up.  If so, it may cause the game to lock up.  If it
happens repeatedly, contact DWANGO technical support.


"Why can't I play external WADS?!"

You MUST have a directory underneath the directory where your game is
called WADS (for example C:\DOOM2\WADS.)  ALL WADS must go in that 
subdirectory except the main one (i.e. doom2.wad/heretic.wad/doom.wad).


"My games are running slow, what could be causing this?"
  
1.  Your modem could be connecting with error correction and or data
    compression not disabled.  You will need to check their modem manual 
    to make sure that this is disabled correctly.

2.  You should disable SMARTDRIVE if running it.

3.  If you are running full-screen and have a slow cpu or a slow video
    card, you should reduce the screen size to improve speed.  (Or switch
    to low-detail)

4.  You could be encountering line noise.  Re-log to see if the connection 
    improves.  If you feel you have an excessive line noise problem, contact 
    the phone company to have your line checked.


"How do I change which server I'm calling?"

The best way to change which server you are calling is to type dwango -server
(must be typed in small letters)  from your game prompt.  This will allow you
to re-select your default server.  


"How do I change my baud rate, com port or modem initialization string?"

All of these can be changed by typing dwango -config (must be typed in
small letters) from your game prompt.


"I'm creating a new account, but it won't accept anything I type.  What do I
do?"

You can move the cursor up and down, but you won't be able to actually enter
information until you hit enter on a given field.  The color of that field
will turn black, and a cursor will appear in it.  You will now be able to
enter your information in that field.


"I am able to log on to DWANGO fine.  However, when I launch into a game my
computer locks up before it gets past all that game initialization gibberish
that I always see at the beginning of the game.  How do I fix it?"

You probably have a shortage of available memory.  Even if you have 8 or even
16 megs of ram, you still could have memory problems caused by having many
things (drivers and such) loaded into conventional memory.  Clean boot your
computer (re-boot your computer and hit F5 when it says "starting MS-DOS")
before trying again.


"When I try to play a game on DWANGO, I get all the way to a black screen
with music, but it just stays there. "

Someone probably hit the Esc key while waiting for the computers to
synchronize.  This can sometimes take up to 90 secs, so just wait it out.
If, after 90 seconds you are still at the Black Screen of Death (as we so
lovingly like to call it), then someone else probably hit Esc.

"When I type dwango, my computer says "initializing modem", but it just stays
there.  What do I do?"


First, you need to download the new version of the client software, which can
be obtained through our BBS at (713) 467-9272 or on the web at
www.dwango.com.  After you have the new software, type dwango -config from
your game prompt.  This will enable you to re-select your modem initialization
string, which is probably the culprit.  If you have difficulty finding your
modem on the list, or the string for you modem doesn't work, try the second
Hayes Optima string.  It works for a wide variety of modems.

"When I type dwango, it dials and says "attempting to connect", but it just
stays there.  What do I do?"

It could be either a bad initialization string or bad baud rate.  Ensure that
your baud rate is set to 19200.  If it still won't connect, try choosing a
different modem initialization string (possibly the 2nd Hayes Optima).


"When I try to log on to DWANGO, my computer dials too many (or too few)
numbers and it fails to connect."

Make sure you have correctly selected whether the server you are calling is
long distance or local.  If you are unsure whether you did it right the first
time, type dwango -server (in small letters) to re-select your default server.
You will also be able to re-select whether it is a long distance or local
call.  Also ensure that you don't disable call waiting unless you have call
waiting.
