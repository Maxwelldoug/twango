# tcpwango-master
 A revival of the old Dial-up multiplayer service DWANGO to be run under modern computers in systems like pcem, 86box, and dosbox.
Currently, there is no code, as the project is not prepared for release, and in fact we haven't even started. as we decompile the old executables and begin building our own system, expect to see things appear.
